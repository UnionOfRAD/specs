## Symbol

The symbol is a stylized pyramid. The symbol is kept abstract in contrast to a real world _object_. It emphasizes the cleanliness and pure simplicity of the shape of both code and symbol. Within a text only context `∆` can be used to imitate the symbol.

## Typography

The font used for the _Lithium_ text is _Helvetica Medium Extended_.

## Color

The color theme is named _Lithium in Neon_. It's inspired by the colors occurring when [burning a piece of lithium](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Flammenf%C3%A4rbungLi.png). An external tool for playing around with the theme can be found on [this page](http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/630252). Following the commonly used colors.
