# li₃ Specifications 

Specifications (or _specs_ for short) help us take li₃ further. A spec either has _draft_ or _accepted_ status and can hold nearly anything that may influence, align or guide the project in technical, visual or other theoretical ways.

## Drafts

Drafts are the first step to a standard and are - in contrast to standards - incomplete or prototypical. Some drafts have already been partially implemented or influenced the development, others may not be _active_ anymore and kept for historical purposes.

Drafts may also be created outside this repository inside the main li₃ repository issue tracker. They are <a href="https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium/issues?labels=rfc">labeled with the RFC tag</a>.

## Standards

Once a spec reaches _accepted_ status it becomes a standard and is assigned an identifier in the form of `LSR-X`. LSR stands for Lithium Standard Recommendation.

Before the accepted status is reached a spec may go through the _draft_ and _proposed_ stages.

## Inherited Standards

li₃ also follows selected external standards, created by the _PHP Framework Interoperability Group_:
